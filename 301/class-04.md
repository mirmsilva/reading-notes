# Day 4 Reading Notes

## React Docs - Forms

- What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
  - a component that maintains its own state and updates based on user input

- Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.


- How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

## The Conditional Operator Explained

- Why would we use a ternary operator?
  - it does the same thing as an if statement with less typing

- Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
  if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }
  - x = y >= ? 'yes' : 'no'
