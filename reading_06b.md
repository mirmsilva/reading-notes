# Computers

## How they work
input, storage, processing, output

- **input** information that tells a computer what to do. Keyboards, mouse, phone
- **storage & process** inputs are stored in memory for the processor to be output. 
- **CPU** central processing units. takes binary input and tells the computer how to do a thing. receives commands telling it what circut to use for a specific job. 
- **output** the output depends on what the computer was designed to do
-- **operating system** the master program that manages how software uses hardware. Think macOs, windows OS, Linux OS

## Binary & Data
- computers work on 1s & 0s telling circuts to turn on or off
- - 1 - true, on
- - 0 - false, off
- Binary numbers can be used to represent numbers, texts or images

## Circuts & Logic
- to process information computers use circuts
- logic gates are used to perform multiple calculations
- 
## Hardware & Spfatware
- Circuts, chips, screen and other physical parts are the hardware.
- the stuff you dont see is the software.
- software tells the computer what to do.
