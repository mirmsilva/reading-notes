The transform property can be rendered in two settings 2D or 3D.
to use call the transform property followed by a value and the specific amount

**2D transforms**
- work on an x & y plane
- the rotate value allows the ability to rotate an element clockwise (+ value) or counterclockwise(- value). the default point of rotation is the center value
- scale value allows you to change the appeared size of the element

**3D transforms**
- work on and x & y & z plane
- using the rotate value we can rotate an element around the x/y/z axis
- occasionally 3D transforms will be applied on an element that is nested with a parent eleme which is also being transformed. In this even nested elements will not appear in their own 3D space

### Transitions

- Fade
