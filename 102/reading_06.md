# How HTMl, CSS & Javascript fit together
The three languages should be kept in separate files with the HTML page linking the other two files
- HTMl is the content layer. It gives the page a basic structure
- CSS enhances the page with rules about how content is presented
- Javascript determines how the page behaves and interacts

- HTMl Elements are used to describe the structure of the page
- They also provide semantic information

to invoke javascript in HTML <.script src = "javafilename.js"></.script>

## Vocab
- **statements** are an individual instruction or step. statements should end with a semicolon;
- **code views** shows the code created by the visual editor
- **visual editors** resemble code processors. 
- **semantic markup** elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your webpage but, add information
- **structural markup** elements that describe both the headdings and the paragraphs

# How Computers Work videos

## How they work
input, storage, processing, output

- **input** information that tells a computer what to do. Keyboards, mouse, phone
- **storage & process** inputs are stored in memory for the processor to be output. 
- **CPU** central processing units. takes binary input and tells the computer how to do a thing. receives commands telling it what circut to use for a specific job. 
- **output** the output depends on what the computer was designed to do
-- **operating system** the master program that manages how software uses hardware. Think macOs, windows OS, Linux OS

## Binary & Data
- computers work on 1s & 0s telling circuts to turn on or off
- - 1 - true, on
- - 0 - false, off
- Binary numbers can be used to represent numbers, texts or images

## Circuts & Logic
- to process information computers use circuts
- logic gates are used to perform multiple calculations
- 
## Hardware & Spfatware
- Circuts, chips, screen and other physical parts are the hardware.
- the stuff you dont see is the software.
- software tells the computer what to do.
