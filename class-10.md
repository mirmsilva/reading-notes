# Day 10 Reading Notes

## Javascript

Debugging is the process of finding errors by process of deduction

the console log helps to narrow down the location of where the error is taking plcae

javascript processes one line of code at a time. When it needs data from another function, it stacks the new function on top of the current task

everytime a script enters a new execution context there are two phases:
1. prepare: the scope, variables, functions and arguments are created
2. execute: now it can assign value to variables, reference functions and run their code
