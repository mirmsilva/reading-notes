# Day 12 Reading Notes

## Entity Framework and APIs

- Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, open source and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.
- Data access is performed using a model
  - A model is made up of entity classes and a context object that represents a session with the database
  - The context object allows querying and saving data

### Data Seeding

the process of populating a database with an initial set of data.

There are several ways this can be accomplished in EF Core:
- Model seed data
- Manual migration customization
- Custom initialization logic

### User Secrets
A secure way of storing private user information such as API keys, client secrets, and connection strings. Anything that you donâ€™t want others to know about when using your code base.
