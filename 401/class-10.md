# Day 10 Reading Notes
## Stacks
- A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack but, not the previous
- Stacks follow FILO & LIFO

### Terminology
- **Push** Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed into the stack by assigning it as the new top
- **Pop** Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped & removed from the top. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- **Top** This is the top of the stack.
- **Peek** When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- **IsEmpty** Returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

## Queue
- areused when you want to make sure things happen in the order in which they were called
- Queues follow FIFO & LIFO

### Terminology
- **Enqueue** Nodes or items that are added to the back of the queue
- **Dequeue** Nodes or items that are removed from the front of the queue
- **Front** This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- **Rear** This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- **Peek** When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue
- **IsEmpty** Returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
