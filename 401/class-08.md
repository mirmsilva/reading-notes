# Day 8 Reading Notes
## Collections
- Collections provide a more flexible way to work with groups of objects. Unlike arrays, the group of objects may grow and shrink dynamically as needed
- A collection is a class the must be declared before you add elements
- If your collection contains elements of only one data tyoe, you can use one of the classes in the System.Collections.Generic namespace to enforce type safety
- You can iterate through a List

System.Collections.Generic,Classes

**Dictionary<TKey,TValue>**	Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are organized based on the key.

**List<T>**	Represents a list of objects that can be accessed by index. Provides methods to search, sort, and modify lists.
  
**Queue<T>**	Represents a first in, first out (FIFO) collection of objects.
  
**SortedList<TKey,TValue>**	Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are sorted by key based on the associated IComparer<T> implementation.
  
**Stack<T>**	Represents a last in, first out (LIFO) collection of objects.
