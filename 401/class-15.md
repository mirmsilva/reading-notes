# Day 15 Reading Notes
## Trees

trees are made up of edges that connect nodes

### Vocab:
- Node: A node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes
- Root:  The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- Edge: The link between a parent and child node
- Leaf: A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- Height:  The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf
- K-ary Trees: Have more than two children nodes
- A Binary Search Tree (BST):  A type of tree that does have some structure attached to it

## Traversal:

### Depth First
- Pre-Order: root -> left -> right
- In-Order: left -> root -> right
- Post-Order: left -> right -> root

### Breadth First
Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.
