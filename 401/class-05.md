# Day 5 Reading Notes
## Linked Lists

## What are they?
- Linear data strictures. There is an order and a sequence to how the are constructed and traversed
- A sequence of Nodes that are connected to each other, each Node references the next Node in the link
- Singly/Doubly refer to the number of references the node has
  - Singly has one reference: the next node
  - Double has two references: the previous node and the next node
- The first node is always called the Head
- The best way to traverse a linked list is a while loop
- linked lists allow you to store in memory without having to set aside a block of memmory. They can grow dynamically.
- Linked lists can be very efficient when you want to add or remove items. But can be a time suck when you want to search and find a single element
