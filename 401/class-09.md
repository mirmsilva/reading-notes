# Day 9 Reading Notes
## LINQ
Language Intergrated Query
- A set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language
- With LINQ, a query is a first-class language construct, just like classes, methods, events
- Query expressions are written in a declarative query syntax. By using query syntax, you can perform filtering, ordering, and grouping operations on data sources with a minimum of code
- The variables in a query expression are all strongly typed

## LINQ Queries
- A query is an expression that retrieves data from a data source
- In a LINQ query, you are always working with objects
- Parts of a Query Operation
  - Obtain the data source
  - Create the query
  - Execute the query
- The query specifies what information to retrieve from the data source or source
- The actual execution of the query is deferred until you iterate over the query variable in a foreach statement
