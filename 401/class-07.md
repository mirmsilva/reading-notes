# Day 7 Reading Notes
## Interfaces
An interface contains definitions for a group of related functionalities that non-abstract class or a struct must implement. 

An interface may define static methods, which must have an implementation

By using interfaces you may include behavior from multiple sources in a class

The name of an interface must begin with a capital I

An interface is like an abstract base class with abstract members

An interface can't be instantiated directly. Its members are implemented by any class or struct that implements the interface

An interface is trying to seperate how we use something from how it is implemented
