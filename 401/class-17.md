## Swagger
Swagger is behind some of the most well-known, and widely used tools for implementing the OpenAPI specification. The Swagger toolset includes a mix of open source, free, and commercial tools, which can be used at different stages of the API lifecycle.

It allows you to view how your API will behave before it is implemented
