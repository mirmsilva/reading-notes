# Day 2 Reading Notes
## Unit Tests
- They are a way to test specific components of your code and are not meant to test the entirety of your app
- Test Anatomy
    - **Arrange** everything you need in order to run the experiment
    - **Act** invoke the method and check the result
    - **Assert** the hypothesis. You should have one per method
- Avoid test interdependence

## Art of README
- README is your way to tell anyone using your app what it is & how to use it
- Best Practices
    - Tell them what it is
    - show them what it looks like
    - show them how to use it
    - give them any other relevant information
    - keep it concise
