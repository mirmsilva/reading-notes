# Day 13 Reading Notes

## Dependency Injection & Repo Design Pattern

A dependency is an object that another object depends on.

### Repository Pattern

- Repositories are classes or components that encapsulate the logic required to access data sources

- They centralize common data access functionality, providing better maintainability and decoupling the infrastructure or technology used to access databases from the domain model layer

- Having a good Repo pattern allows you to more easily test your application logic
